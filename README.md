# doctest - Run tests in Elisp docstring

## Example

For example, with this Emacs Lisp file, `M-x doctest-check-feature foo` will check if `(foo-add 1 2)` equals to `3`.

```emacs-lisp
;;; foo.el --- Foo  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

(defun foo-add (x y)
  "Add X to Y.

  (foo-add 1 2)
  ;; => 3"
  (+ x y))

(provide 'foo)
```

## How to write tests?

Use this format:

    (func arg1 arg2 ...)
    ;; => RESULT

The test is considered if two adjacent lines matches the regexp:

``` emacs-lisp
;; first line matches
(rx bol (* space) "(")
;; second line matches
(rx bol (* space) ";; => ")
```

Unfortunately, we can't (or shouldn't) put `(` at the beginning of a line (see
the following quote), and because I don't like `\(`, doctest.el recognizes
whitespaces before `(`, not `\`.

>      The argument FOO can be either a number
>      \(a buffer position) or a string (a file name).
>
> This prevents the open-parenthesis from being treated as the start
> of a defun (*note Defuns: (emacs)Defuns.).

## How to run tests?

### Run tests interactively

use `M-x doctest-check-feature FEATURE` to check functions defined in `FEATURE`.

### Run tests in batch mode

Use `doctest-batch-check-feature`, e.g., to check features `foo` and `bar`

``` shell
emacs -Q --batch -L /path/to/doctest -l doctest -f doctest-batch-check-feature foo bar
```
